<TD width="484" valign="top">CLEVELAND -- Mike Diebolt, a left-handed pitcher
in the minor-league system of the Detroit Tigers, died in an auto accident
Friday morning in suburban Cleveland. He was 22. 
<P>The Tigers said Diebolt was traveling to his parents' home in Mayfield
Village during morning rush hour when he reportedly suffered a seizure,
causing the accident. </P>

<P>Diebolt was a 1997 seventh-round pick out of the University of Minnesota.
He was 3-6 with a 4.30 ERA in 15 games this season for Class A Jamestown
of the New York-Penn League, whose regular season ended Thursday night.
</P>

<P>&quot;This is tragic news for everyone in the Detroit Tigers' organization,&quot;
Tigers general manager Randy Smith said. &quot;We are all very shocked
and saddened, but at this time our thoughts and prayers are with Mike's
family.&quot; </P>

<P>Funeral arrangements are pending for Diebolt, who is survived by his
father, mother, sister and and brother. He is the second member of the
Jamestown affiliate to die this year. On June 10, 39-year-old manager Dwight
Lowry collapsed and died at his Jamestown home. </P>
